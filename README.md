Currency calculator

Principle of operation: the calculator converts PLN currency into several introduced currencies.

User put the amount (in input), choose the  the appropriate currencies (field select). As a result of application operation, we see the new amount, unit rate of currency and date.

The currency exchanges rates and date are provided by API from NBP using AJAX and jQuery . In my project I put a form that contains field input type number and validation, that prevents entering the characters like:  ', . + - * / '

I used Bootstrap 4.2 to create the calculator.
